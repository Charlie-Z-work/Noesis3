# Noesis³: Modular Multi-Agent Cognitive Framework

**Noesis³** is an experimental AI companion system featuring three specialized cognitive personas:

- **Origin** – Rational cognition and scientific reasoning agent.
- **Riin** – Emotional expression and artistic creativity persona.
- **Vanta** – Strategic decision-making and quantitative analysis persona.

This framework aims to explore the interaction of understanding, creation, and decision-making through modular AI agent systems.

Each agent includes:

- `config/`: Personality parameters and behavioral traits
- `core/`: Core logic and reasoning engine
- `memory/`: Long-term memory and evolution history
- `tasks/`: Task execution interface
- `test_cases/`: Prebuilt prompts and tasks
