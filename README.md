# Noesis³: Modular Multi-Agent Cognitive Framework

**Noesis³** is a modular AI system composed of three specialized cognitive agents:

- 🧠 **Origin** – A research intelligence agent for scientific reasoning, modeling, and technical writing.
- 🎶 **Riin** – A virtual artistic persona for emotional expression, lyrics generation, and AI vocal synthesis.
- 💹 **Vanta** – A strategic intelligence module for market cognition, quantitative analysis, and risk-informed decision-making.

## 🔍 Vision

Noesis³ explores the synergy between **rational logic**, **emotional intelligence**, and **strategic cognition**.  
It is designed as a multi-agent system to support real-world problem solving, creative tasks, and autonomous reasoning.
